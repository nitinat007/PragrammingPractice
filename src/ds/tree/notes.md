Important Points

* Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1.
* Full Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children
* In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
* Perfect Binary Tree: A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
* Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
* Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. Eg:  Red-Black trees
* Skewed Binary Tree: A skewed binary tree is a type of binary tree in which all the nodes have only either one child or no child. They are of two type: Left Skewed, Right Skewed
* k-ary tree: A tree where every node has either 0 or k children
*  In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
* AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.  The height of an AVL tree is always O(Logn) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We make sure that height of the tree remains O(Logn) after every insertion and deletion.
